# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to this pattern library!

Follow the below steps to make your contributions as effortless as possible.

1. Ensure you have the latest code with `git pull origin develop`
2. Create a local branch off of `develop` following Gitflow naming conventions:
   - **feature**/feature-name
   - **fix**/fix-name
   - **refactor**/refactor-name
3. Make local changes (create/edit/rename/delete files).
4. Commit early and often, using very clear commit messages.
5. When ready to deploy your code, `git push -u origin feature/branch-name`
6. On Bitbucket, create a pull request to merge your feature onto the base `develop` branch
7. Completely fill out the pull request template and add at least one additional reviewer
8. Apply any necessary changes to your code after review comments and push to your remote branch
9. After the PR is approved, merge your code with the **Squash** strategy into the `develop` branch with the "Close source branch" option checked
10. Delete your local feature branch (periodically run `git fetch --prune`)

Happy coding! ðŸ˜„
