# Breadcrumbs

## Overview

Breadcrumbs are a secondary navigation element that aids users in easily understanding the relation between their location on a page and higher level pages.

<Story name="Default">
  {stories.breadcrumbs()}
</Story>

<br />

### When to use this

- Breadcrumbs are used when pages have depths of information where going back to a section could be useful for the user.

## How it works

- Breadcrumbs are fixed underneath the hero image, above the content of the page.


## Visual Details

### Color

- Each link element is Brand Blue
- The page the user is on will be last in the sequence of links, and represented as an unclickable, regular weight, System Gray 50 text.
