# Buttons

Buttons direct users to take action within a site. Buttons come in many forms and styles and help guide a user in completing a task or navigating an experience.

<Story name="All">
  {stories.All()}
</Story>

## When to Use Buttons

Buttons should be used when one or more actions need to be taken or a user needs to be directed to another location within the website. The different types of buttons can be used on any hierarchy group.

### Text Buttons

- Used when an action is straightforward and doesn't need a supporting icon


<Story name="Text">
  {stories.Text()}
</Story>

<br />

<Story name="Link" parameters={{ docs: { disable: true }}}>
  {stories.Link()}
</Story>

### Icon + Text Buttons

- Used when a visual indicator will help clarify the action described in the label

<Story name="Icon + Text">
  {stories.IconWithText()}
</Story>

### Icon Only Buttons

- There are certain icons that are naturally understood by a user of the platform and don't require a text label to be understood. (i.e. a magnifying glass as the search icon) 

<Story name="Icon Only">
  {stories.Icon()}
</Story>

<br />

## How it Works

Because there are often many buttons on a single screen or page, hierarchy is important to know what buttons are most useful in a situation.

### Primary

Generally there should only be one primary button on the screen at a time. This is reserved for the most relevant and important action to take.

_Example labels: Learn More, Apply, Log In_

<Preview>
  <button type="button" class="acg-btn acg-btn--primary">
    Primary Button
  </button>
</Preview>

### Secondary

If there is more than one button on the page, every button after the primary button will be styled as secondary.

_Example labels: Edit, Add, Cancel_


<Preview>
  <button type="button" class="acg-btn acg-btn--secondary">
    Secondary Button
  </button>
</Preview>

### Link

Button variant that resembles hyperlinks.

<Preview>
  <button type="button" class="acg-btn acg-btn--link">
    Link Button
  </button>
</Preview>

## Layout

### Stacked Buttons

Primary buttons should be furthest to the top when stacked with secondary button(s) or text links.

### Inline Buttons

Primary buttons should be furthest to the right when used inline with secondary buttons.
