# Document Summary Banner

Document Summary Banners are used to pair information and access to PDFs that provide information about a product, offering, etc.

<br />

<Story name="Default">
  {stories.Default()}
</Story>

<br />

## Without excerpt

<br />

<Story name="Without Excerpt">
  {stories.WithoutExcerpt()}
</Story>

<br />


### Visual Styling

Document Summary Banners have a unique file icon to identify itself quickly from a product, or similar, page.



A secondary button is associated with the Document Summary Banner block that links to associated documents for the user to access and/or download.
