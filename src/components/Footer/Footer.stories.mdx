# Footer

The footer is displayed at the bottom of most pages. It houses helpful links that aren't needed within the Primary Navigation. It's common to provide links to support, release notes, and marketing materials in the footer.

<Story name="Default" parameters={{ options: { showPanel: false } }}>
  {stories.Default()}
</Story>
