# Text Field

Text fields allow customers to enter a single line of text. This can be used for names, email addresses, home addresses, passwords, and more.

<Story name="Default">
  {textInput()}
</Story>

### When to use this component

Use text fields when you want to:

- Allow people to enter a short or single line of text

### When not to use this component

Don't use text fields when you want to:

- Allow people to enter a long or multi-line text

## Layout

Text fields can be laid out in stack or inline form.

### Inline

- Use an inline layout when vertical space is limited.
- Spacing between each text field is Inline 16

### Stack

- Use a stack layout when horizontal space is limited.
- Spacing between each text field is Stack 16

## States

### Empty

- This is the default state of all text fields
- Placeholder text is not a replacement for labels. If any instructions are required, use labels or hints outside of the text field. Use placeholder text to show examples of the input.

### Focus

- This is when the person has clicked or tabbed to the text field and is typing

### Filled

- This is when the person has entered text but is no longer focused on the text field

### Error

- This is when the person has entered something incorrectly into the text field
- Error text should succinctly explain how to resolve the error

### Validated

- This is when the person has resolved an error. A good example of this is for a password field. If the user mistypes their password, and then fixes it, it would show a validated state.

### Disabled

- Use this when interaction should be blocked
