# Search

Visually, search fields are the same as text fields. The main difference being the addition of a search icon within the field.

Functionally they differ from text fields. Search fields can be used to filter a list of items, live or after submitting an explicit "search" action.

## Visual Details

### Active state

- When the search input is in its active state, a blue border will show up within the input. At this point the user can begin their search
