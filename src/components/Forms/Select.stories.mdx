# Selects

Selects are typically used within forms and therefore visually similar to text fields. When clicking on a select a menu of options expand from within a popover.

<Story name="Select Dropdown">
  {stories.selectDropdown()}
</Story>

## Visual Details

### Sizes

There are three sizes for selects: large, medium and small.

## States

### Default

- An unpopulated selection field that displays placeholder text as “Select an option” or “Select option(s)"
- Best practice: use the Default Filled state with the most frequently used option preselected when possible.

### Hover

- When a user’s cursor is overtop of the component

### Focus

- When a user has tabbed the selection field into focus
- Hitting enter will expand the field to the active state

### Active

- This is when a user has clicked or hit enter on the selection field
- The popover will expand to display the list of selectable options

### Default Filled

- An option has been selected or pre-filled and the component is not in focus

### Disabled

- Interaction with the component is blocked

### Error

- Something has been selected incorrectly
- Most commonly used if a required selection has not been made
