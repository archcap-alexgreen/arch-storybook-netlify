# Hero Blocks

Heroes are the combination of images, graphic elements, colors, and information found at the top of each page. 


## Types of Heroes

## Styles

### Homepage

Homepage heroes are found on the Arch Capital Group landing page and subsequent segment landing pages. Homepage heroes contain a full width image and two dynamic shapes layered on top of the image. The first dynamic shape is a vertically positioned shape and the second dynamic shape contains the information of the hero.

#### Colors

Both dynamic shapes on Homepage heroes should aim to be the same color. The dynamic shape containing the hero information should be at full opacity. The dynamic shape overlaying the background image has a 50% opacity.

### Slanted

Slanted heroes consist of an image overlayed with a fully opaque dynamic shape. The header and subcopy of the page are contained withing this dynamic shape. Slanted hero styles are found on pages that are more unique and created with layouts custom made for the type of content present on the page.

Examples of these pages include:

* Careers
* Sustainability
* Insights

* News Pages
