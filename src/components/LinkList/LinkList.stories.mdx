# Link List

Link lists provide a way to show a variety of links in one block.

There are 2 types of link lists.

## With Columns
Columns are a simple list of links that can be set in 1-3 columns.

<br />

<Story name="With Columns">
  {stories.WithColumns()}
</Story>

<br />

## With Borders
Borders are similar to columns but provide a divider between each link.

<br />

<Story name="With Borders">
  {stories.WithBorders()}
</Story>

## With Dates
This pattern can be modified to display dates. This is useful for displaying timely information like press releases.
<br />

<Story name="With Dates">
  {stories.WithDates()}
</Story>
