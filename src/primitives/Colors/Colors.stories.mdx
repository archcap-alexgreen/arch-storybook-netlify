# Colors

The colors outlined below are based on the Arch Capital Brand Guidelines and will provide a cohesive and consistent aesthetic for its website.

To ensure Arch's website is accessible for all users, the chosen colors/text + background combinations have been adjusted to provide acceptable color contrast for optimal readability. The contrast ratio of text and interactive elements meet [level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).

## Color Story

The Color storybook stories show a few different views of the color system. First, you can view all the colors in a single grid, with their hex value, name, and variable name. You can also view colors by color group (Brand, Secondary, and System). For each color in each of these views, you can also see all of the colors in the system that are accessible to combine with the given color. Each accessible color is tagged with `AA`, `AA Large`, `AAA`, and `AAA Large`. Any color that isn't at least `AA` accessible is hidden from view. This means that for any colors paired and displayed in this view, you can use them together as foreground and background colors in components. If a color pair does not appear in this view, you should not use it in combination on the site, as it is not accessible for people with low vision.

## Color Groups

The three color groups suggest when colors should be used:

| Semantic Group | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Brand          | Brand colors will primarily signify action or call attention to different parts of the website. |
| Secondary      | Secondary colors are found in CTA modules as both background and text colors. |
| System         | System colors are primarily used for non-interactive text or elements that support text such as dividers, text fields, backgrounds etc. |
