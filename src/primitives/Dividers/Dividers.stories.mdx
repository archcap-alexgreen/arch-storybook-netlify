# Dividers

Dividers act similar to cards in that they separate sections of content in the UI. They provide a visual pause between groups of content when a user is navigating through lists and layouts.

## When to use dividers

A divider should be used primarily when there is a list of elements that are distinct from each other and need to be read and acted upon individually.

Horizontal or vertical dividers can be used on a layout that displays a list of items or sections. They can also be used within cards.

It can be helpful to think of dividers the same way you think of a period at the end of a sentence. Once a thought is complete, it may be time to add a divider so users know the next group of content is starting.

## Visual Details

### Stroke Weight

- Dividers will have a stroke weight of 1px.

### Spacing

For horizontal dividers, stack spacing will need to be used above and below it to ensure consistent vertical spacing between elements. The stack spacing may vary depending on the content displayed, but here are some general use cases.

- When there are many dividers used together, such as in a list, the spacing between elements is less (seen in tables)
- If there arenâ€™t many dividers together, or you are separating sections of content within a card, the spacing between each divider is greater.

Vertical dividers use inline spacing to the left and right of it, to ensure consistent horizontal space between elements. The inline spacing may vary depending on the content displayed.

### Color

All dividers will use System Gray 20 for the border color.
