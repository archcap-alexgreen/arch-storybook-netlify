# Spacing

The following guidelines are used to ensure consistency across the pages within the Arch Capital Group website.

## How spacing is used

As different objects are placed in proximity with other objects in a UI, we need to know the right amount of space to put around and between them. You can see how specific amounts and types of spacing are used in the breakdown below.

## How it works

### Inset

Inset spacing distances all content equally from its border on all four sides.

Depending on the context, different sizes of inset ranging from Inset 4 to Inset 64. When deciding on which inset spacing to use, the amount and size of elements used and their relation to the container it will be in are considered.

<Story name="Inset">
  {stories.inset()}
</Story>

Inset spacing is used most commonly in these contexts:

- Inset for a card containing information
- Inset for system information banner

| Name     | All Sides |
| -------- | --------: |
| Inset 4  |       4px |
| Inset 8  |       8px |
| Inset 12 |      12px |
| Inset 16 |      16px |
| Inset 24 |      24px |
| Inset 32 |      32px |
| Inset 64 |      64px |


### Squish

Squish is similar to inset except it reduces space on the top and bottom.

Depending on the context, you can add different sizes of squish ranging from Squish 2 to Squish 32. When deciding on which squish spacing to use, the amount and size of elements used and their relation to the container it will be in are considered.

<Story name="Squish">
  {stories.squish()}
</Story>

Squish spacing is used most commonly in these contexts:

- Buttons
- Table cells
- Cell-like containers (data tables, list items, etc.)

| Name         | Top & Bottom | Left & Right |
| ------------ | -----------: | -----------: |
| Squish 2-4   |          2px |          4px |
| Squish 4-8   |          4px |          8px |
| Squish 8-12  |          8px |         12px |
| Squish 8-16  |          8px |         16px |
| Squish 12-16 |         12px |         16px |
| Squish 16-24 |         16px |         24px |
| Squish 32-64 |         32px |         64px |


### Stack

Stack spacing is the vertical space between elements.

Depending on the context, you can add different sizes of stack ranging from Stack 2 to Stack 64. When deciding on which stack size to use, the text, interactive/graphic elements that will be stacked and the readability and touch targets of those elements when in close proximity are considered.

<Story name="Stack">
  {stories.stack()}
</Story>

Stack spacing is used most commonly in these contexts:

- Vertical space between cards
- Vertical space between text elements in a card or container

| Name     | Vertical Space |
| -------- | -------------: |
| Stack 2  |            2px |
| Stack 4  |            4px |
| Stack 8  |            8px |
| Stack 12 |           12px |
| Stack 16 |           16px |
| Stack 24 |           24px |
| Stack 32 |           32px |
| Stack 64 |           64px |

### Inline

Inline spacing is the horizontal space between elements.

Depending on the context, you can add different sizes of inset ranging from Inline 2 to Inline 64. When deciding on which inline size to use, the text, interactive/graphic elements that will be aligned together and the readability and touch targets of those elements when in close proximity are considered.

<Story name="Inline">
  {stories.inline()}
</Story>

Inline spacing is used most commonly in these contexts:

- Horizontal space between cards
- Horizontal space between elements in a card or container

| Name      | Horizontal Space |
| --------- | ---------------: |
| Inline 2  |              2px |
| Inline 4  |              4px |
| Inline 8  |              8px |
| Inline 12 |             12px |
| Inline 16 |             16px |
| Inline 24 |             24px |
